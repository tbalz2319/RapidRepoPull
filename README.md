## Created and Maintained by

- Talal Balouch (Twitter @xtbalz)

## Description

- This program uses Python to clone/maintain multiple security related repos using threading and multiprocessing

## Goal

- The goal of this program is to quickly pull and install repos from its list

## Use cases

- Quickly install your favorite Security repos on a new system

- Kick off multiple concurrent git clone tasks utilizing Python

- Add/remove Security related Github repos to the default.xt list as needed in order to address     indivudual use case/project needs

- Clone repos to review offline while traveling without internet connectivity

## Requirements

- This program was tested with Python3 version 3.8.9 64-bit

- Ensure the Python3 virtual environment package is installed (Ubuntu)

    ```sudo apt-get install python3-venv```

- Ensure git is installed (Ubuntu)

    ```sudo apt-get install git```

## Usage Option 1 Automatic (Docker)

### This option does not allow a user to specify the number of threads or a text file including additional repos

- Clone code repo

    ```git clone https://github.com/tbalz2319/RapidRepoPull.git```

- Change directory into RapidRepoPull

    ```cd RapidRepoPull```

- The script will run in a minimal Alpine Docker container (126 MB) and extract the dirs in the current working dir

    ```docker-compose up --build```

## Usage Option 2 Local Install

- Clone code repo

    ```git clone https://github.com/tbalz2319/RapidRepoPull.git```

- Change directory into RapidRepoPull

    ```cd RapidRepoPull```

- Execute the script below

    ```./install.sh```

## Usage Option 3 Manual

- Clone code repo

    ```git clone https://github.com/tbalz2319/RapidRepoPull.git```

- Change directory into RapidRepoPull

    ```cd RapidRepoPull```

- Create a virtual Python3 environment to run this code

    ```python3 -m venv venv```

- Activate the virual enivornment

    ```source venv/bin/activate```

- Install requirements

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Run program

    ```python rapid.py```

## Usage Option 4 Custom

- Clone code repo

    ```git clone https://github.com/tbalz2319/RapidRepoPull.git```

- Change directory into RapidRepoPull

    ```cd RapidRepoPull```

- Execute the script below

    ```./option4.sh```

- The script will exit while leaving the program in a python virtual env indicated by (venv)

- Use the help menu below to navigate options

    ```Usage: rapid.py [OPTIONS]```

    ```test
       Options:
       -v, --verbose      Will print verbose messages.
       -f, --file TEXT    Specify a text file with a list of user selected Github repos
       -t, --thread TEXT  Specify the number of CPU threads to use
       -u, --url TEXT     Specify a url to scrape containing Github repos to clone
       --help             Show this message and exit.```

- Example specifying a custom text file with a list of repos and how many threads the script should use

- The text file must reside in the same directory as rapid.py and can be called anything

- The example file "bob.txt" is there to testing an example purposes

    ```python rapid.py -f bob.txt -t 25```

- The example below with scrape a url containing Github to clone and provide verbose output, utilizing 75 threads

   ```python rapid.py -v -u https://apsdehal.in/awesome-ctf -t 75```

## Update Program

- Run the following script

    ```./update.sh```

## Mass Update all existing repos

- Run the command to maintain all existing repos by attempting to pull latest version

    ```./update_repos.sh```

## To do

- Add error handling

- Clean up code

- Implement new features to enhance functionality via cli

## Contribute

- The code for this project is constantly being cleaned up, refactored and refined, there are most likely lots of
  bugs that need to fixed and identified.

- Any help with the project is greatly appreciated

- Pull requests welcomed
